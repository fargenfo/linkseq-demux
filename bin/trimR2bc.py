Description: Program meant for linked reads. It trims barcodes off R2 if the insert size was too short and therefore lead to contamination.
Checks if the 16 first bases in R1 are barcodes in the whitelist.
If positive, it reverse compliments the barcode, and checks if the rev_barcode is in the corresponding R2. If negative, it searches for rev_bc with one mismatch.
Searches from the 5' end and cuts the first match it finds.
Cuts line 4 (containing the base QS) to same length as line 2.
If R1 or R2 are shorter than 16 bp it will not trim.
After trim it checks if line 2 contains nothing (''). If true, replaces '' with 'N' and replaces line 4 with '!'.
Throughput: Approx. 6381 read-pairs/second
Output: A barcode trimmed R2 fastq file (not gzipped).
Input: R1 and R2 must be in two seperate fastq files. If they are gzipped, they must end with '.gz'.
Usage: ./trimR2bc.py <R1fastqfile> <R2fastqfile> <whitelist> <R2outfile> 1>>bctrim_stats.txt
